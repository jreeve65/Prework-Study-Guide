        <h2>HTML</h2>
       <!-- <p>The first step to building starts with code using Hyper Text Markdown Language Commonly known as "HTML"</p>
        <p>The structure of a HTML file is as follows</p> 
        <ul>
          <li>A head</li>
          <li>A body</li>
          <li>A footer</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There are several other tags used to structure these individual parts but these three tags are basically the soul of the webpage or web application</p>

        <h3>The Head</h3>
        
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The head although hidden from the user's view is important because it contains information related to Search Engine Optimaization letting your website reach more people</li>
          <li>A common tag used in the head is "Meta". Commands commonly used within the "Meta" tag are "name", "charset", "content", and "http-equiv".</li>          
                  
        </ul>
        <h3>The Body</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The body element contains the content that is visible to the user</li>
          <li>Common things put in the body are things such as Hyper links, images, and text</li>
          <li>Useful commands for body are, "ul" for unordered lists, and "li" to display a listed item</li>
          
        </ul>-->
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user</li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>there are several ways to implement css code in your program you can do it inline within your html file, you can use an internal style sheet or you can use an external style sheet.  However, most cases you will use an external style sheet for cleaner code then link it to your html file.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>You can add color using a semantic statement such as the name of the color or by using the hashtag symbol followed by its hexidecimal reference.</li>
          <li>In CSS you code using a selector or stating an aspect of the code you want to effect designateing a property ie a color, text alignment etc. and then assgning that property a value ie what color do you want to use.</li>
          <li>You can even assign multiple selectors in the same line of code eliminating the need to repeat already written code using a comma after the first selector followed by the second</li>

       <!-- <p>Git is a method of version control development.  Version control allows web and software developers collaberate by testing and adding/modifiying code in tandum whilst
          leaving the live service/feature unaffected until the changes are ready to be implimented.</p>
          <p>Version control will also allow you to roll back to an earlier version of the code if the new one has a problematic bug that wasn't caught in testing</p>
          <p>You can use git via the command line.  a popular command line program is git bash some useful git bash commands are as follows</p>
       -->
        <ul>
          <li>PWD lets you know what directory you are in.</li>
          <li>CD stands for change directory and allows you to navigate different files on your machine</li>
          <li>MKDIR stands for make directory and it allows you to create a folder on your machine inside your current directory</li>
          <li> GIT STATUS lets you know what branch of a project/repository you are currently working on</li>
          <li> GIT CHECKOUT moves you to a existing branch with in a project/repository.  You can also issue the command GIT CHECKOUT -B to create a new branch and change it to your

        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <p>The first step to building starts with code using Hyper Text Markdown Language Commonly known as "HTML"</p>
        <p>The structure of a HTML file is as follows</p>
        <ul>
          <li>A head</li>
          <li>A body</li>
          <li>A footer</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There are several other tags used to structure these individual parts but these three tags are basically the soul of the webpage or web application</p>

        <h3>The Head</h3>
        
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The head although hidden from the user's view is important because it contains information related to Search Engine Optimaization letting your website reach more people</li>
          <li>A common tag used in the head is "Meta". Commands commonly used within the "Meta" tag are "name", "charset", "content", and "http-equiv".</li>          
                  
        </ul>
        <h3>The Body</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The body element contains the content that is visible to the user</li>
          <li>Common things put in the body are things such as Hyper links, images, and text</li>
          <li>Useful commands for body are, "ul" for unordered lists, and "li" to display a listed item</li>
          
        </ul>

          <p>You can use git via the command line.  a popular command line program is git bash some useful git bash commands are as follows</p>
        <ul>
